title: Is there a danger my Solar Panels will blow off the roof during a storm?
answer: |-
  It’s highly unlikely, when we install the Solar PV panels we make sure they are securely attached to the fabric of the building using a roof hook and rail system. Our panels are always mounted at least 30cm in from the edge of the roof to prevent excessive wind loading. In the hurricane force winds of February 2014 not a single one of our installed Solar panels blew off a roof.
