title: What guarantees will my Solar Panels come with?
answer: |-
  Your Solar Panels will come with a manufacturer’s guarantee of the panels’ performance. Different manufacturers offer different guarantees, with the more premium levels of protection usually associated with the more expensive panels. It’s wise to make sure you understand the guarantee before you purchase, and our technical advisors will be happy to help assist you if you have any questions.

  At Green Energy Together we also offer a full guarantee over the installation and technical assistance from our customer care team for 2 years afterwards. This is in addition to the guarantee offered by the manufacturer.
