title: How long does it take to install Solar Panels?
answer: |-
  Most domestic Solar Panel installations take no more than a day with minimum disruption. Typically, the morning of the installation we will raise an access platform for your roof. We will then mount the panels on the roof and install the inverter, finally carrying out the internal wiring.
  
  All labour is included with your instalaltion, and should you have any special requirements just discuss it with your technical consultant who will be able to assist.
