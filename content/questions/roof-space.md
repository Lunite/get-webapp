title: How much roof space do I need for Solar Panels?
answer: |-
  Solar Panels can be fitted to your roof or on your land. Generally an 8-panel Solar PV system would be one of the smallest we would recommend and this could easily fit on the roof of an average 3-bed semi. Our branded panels generate the most energy per m2 so you can still get plenty of electricity from a smaller roof.
