title: Do Solar Panels need cleaning?
answer: |-
  Solar panels are generally selfcleaning if positioned at an angle of over 15 degrees. However it is advised to visually inspect them annually and rinse if necessary. Most window-cleaning companies have a reach-and-wash system and should be able to clean your panels.
