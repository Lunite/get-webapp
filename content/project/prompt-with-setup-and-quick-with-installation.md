description: "\"I'm really happy with my solar installation, everything was
  installed within the day and looked exactly how they explained on the survey.
  They even gave me some advice regarding a water heater controller I had fitted
  after the panels were installed. I would recommend them to anyone wanting to
  save money as it really made a difference to our bills.\" - Mr. Jones"
