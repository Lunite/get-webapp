  "I'm really happy with my solar installation, everything was installed within
  the day and looked exactly how they explained on the survey. They even gave me
  some advice regarding a water heater controller I had fitted after the panels
  were installed. I would recommend them to anyone wanting to save money as it
  really made a difference to our bills."\
