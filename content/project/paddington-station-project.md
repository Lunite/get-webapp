  Paddington, also known as London Paddington, is a Central London railway
  terminus and London Underground station complex, located on Praed Street in

  The site has been the London terminus of services provided by the Great Western Railway and its successors since 1838. Much of the main line station dates from 1854 and was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.
