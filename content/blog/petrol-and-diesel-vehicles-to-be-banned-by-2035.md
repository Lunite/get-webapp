The Electric Car Revolution 

 

Both fully electric and hybrid vehicles (which combine a battery with a traditional engine as a back-up) have gained a high profile in recent years, with many major manufacturers joining the pioneers in developing models. Three years ago, the UK government that petrol and diesel cars would be banned by 2040, before February's announcement that this would be brought forward to 2035. At the height of the coronavirus lockdown, with roads empty, global pollution levels plummeted. That just underlines the damage that traditional petrol and diesel vehicles are doing to the planet. 

There were already plans to completely replace these with electric vehicles by 2040. In February, however, the government announced that this deadline would be brought forward to 2035, putting the UK ahead of the rest of the world.

### The Challenge of Climate Change 

The effects of climate change should be clear to anyone keeping up with the news, from the catastrophic bushfires in Australia to bizarre weather patterns, and of course the heartbreaking loss of irreplaceable species. Earlier this year, Sir David Attenborough said that "The longer we leave it... the worse it is going to get. So now is the time." 

Unfortunately, the current pandemic has resulted in the planned 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as the COP26 summit, being postponed till next year. This makes it even more vital that existing initiatives are pushed ahead with extra urgency — and that includes turning petrol and diesel cars into history.

Though widely welcomed, this proposal has had a range of reactions. AA president Edmund King was sceptical, saying that "Drivers support measures to clean up air quality and reduce CO2 emissions but these stretched targets are incredibly challenging." On the other hand, Friends of the Earth suggested that 2035, while an improvement, was still not soon enough.  

### The Issues to Be Solved 

The move to eco-friendly driving leaves three main issues still to be solved. One is that the current generation of batteries for electric vehicles are expensive and have a relatively short life. The good news is that manufacturers seem to be addressing this, and it seems likely that the batteries of the future will be up to the task. 

Secondly, we'll need enough charging points to cope with large numbers of vehicles. At present, any electric vehicle owner who doesn't have a personal charging point has to travel a long way to find one, and the charging process is very long-winded. Both aspects need to improve. 

Finally, while electric vehicles generate no carbon dioxide, the electricity itself is likely to have a substantial carbon footprint. This is why, in order for the electric revolution to really work, charging points must be connected to sustainable energy.  

Whether they're private, community or commercial, it's vital that the electricity is generated by solar power or a comparable system. Why not get in touch with us to find out more about the options?
