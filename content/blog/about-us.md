<p>For more than a decade, our team has designed, engineered, installed and maintained tens of thousands of domestic rooftops and commercial solar power systems across the UK. Our experience covers all facets of solar - from large-scale ground mount to bespoke designs and a number of historic British landmarks, such as King&rsquo;s College Hospital and Paddington Train Station.</p>
<h3>Our history</h3>
<p>It all began as a family solar panel business in 2009 in Hertfordshire, England. Over the years, the business has grown considerably, both fuelling and sustaining the increasing awareness and adoption of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>Today, Green Energy Together is a leading British solar energy company with over 320MW of solar installed. Our team has many years of experience in the renewable industry across a variety of technologies, including solar PV, solar thermal, energy storage and air source. </p>\
<h3>Disrupting the domestic solar market</h3>
<p><br />In 2019 Green Energy Together decided to tackle the domestic solar market with a clear vision - that solar power systems should be for everyone. <br />That is why we have cut out the middleman, offering solutions for residential customers at prices usually found in industrial and commercial settings while ensuring investor-standard warranty and delivery.</p>
<p>As one of the largest installers in the country, our scale allows us to offer unbeatable prices. We not only deal directly with manufacturers, we have in-house Design, Installation, Commissioning and Maintenance teams, ensuring we offer you the service needed.</p>
