Why do people invest in solar power for their homes? Well, besides the obvious benefit to their carbon footprint, helping to combat climate change, the biggest reason is the money they save.

It's even more attractive than ever now to go over to solar, while we're offering an unmissable deal — a 2.75kw system, with a 5kw battery, for £4,999.99 including VAT, with no deposit required. So how much could this system save you?

It depends on a number of factors.

### Where Are You in the UK?

Although solar panels aren't dependent on direct sunlight to gather power, the amount of electricity they'll generate will vary according to the amount of daylight available. 

Needless to say, this will vary with where you live. The north of Scotland would generate least, while the south coast and East Anglia would normally generate most. This could slash your electricity bills, but the amount will depend on a couple of factors.

### Getting the Most from Your Solar Panels

It's vital that the panels should be able to gather daylight without anything blocking the way. If you have trees casting a shade on the roof, for example, less light will be caught by the panels and therefore less electricity generated.

This will help you generate as much energy as possible, but the benefit could be reduced if heat is escaping from your home. To make the most of the large savings offered by solar, you should have your home well insulated, with high-quality double-glazing.

### How to Make More of Your Solar Power

If your solar panels are producing more electricity than you need, it doesn't have to be wasted. You can store it in the battery for your own use, or you can also sell some of your excess to the National Grid, under the Smart Export Guarantee.

The amount you'll get for this varies immensely, depending on your energy supplier. Figures range from 0.5p to 5.5p per kWh, so you'll need to consult your present supplier to find out what they offer — and maybe switch to a more generous company.

The saving from taking up our offer of a 2.75kw system, with a 5kw battery, for £4,999.99 including VAT, could be in the region of £600 a year, depending on your usage. In some cases, this could be enough be enough to take you off the grid for much of the day. 

The best way to find out exactly how much you could save is to contact us, and we can give you an estimate of what this offer could mean for you.
