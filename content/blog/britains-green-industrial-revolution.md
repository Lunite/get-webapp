On November 19th UK prime minister Boris Johnson set out a 10-point plan for what he calls 'a green industrial revolution', an ambitious plan to deliver a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic effects on the economy and build towards the net-zero emissions target while creating and supporting up to 250,000 British jobs.

The plan is designed to guide the UK to forge ahead with alleviating its contribution to global warming by 2050, particularly crucial in the run up to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow due to take place in November 2021.

The industry has delivered a cautious welcome in a mixed response. While the plan will mobilise £12 billion of government investment and sets out to create and support up to 250,000 highly-skilled green jobs in the UK, some leading figures say the plans need to be much more ambitious to meet 2050 net zero targets.

### Why not solar?

Lack of incentives for the installation of residential solar PV and storage technology remains a sticking point for the blueprint. According to the BBC, up to two-thirds of UK homes 'fail on energy efficiency targets'.

Recent research indicates that 12 million homes fall below the C grade on Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), which grades properties from A-G. As a result, not only do residents pay larger energy bills, this also pumps tonnes more CO2 into the atmosphere than necessary.

According to Dave Sheridan, executive chairman of modular housing company Ilke Homes "over 1.8 million new-build homes will have been built by 2025 since 2016 – the year in which the government’s original zero-carbon policy was meant to be introduced. As the economy gears up to meet its legally-binding net-zero pledges, nearly all of these homes will have to be retrofitted to meet zero-carbon standards."

A small investment of £5k per home could not only future proof British housing stock, but also cut energy bills and drive down emissions across the country.

### Why solar panels are worth buying

Even without incentives in place, the benefits of solar are still very much worth it, and new statistics demonstrate that solar is increasingly cost-effective compared to other sources, even when renewables must compete with the heavily-subsidized fossil fuel industry.

Ultimately, solar panels are a solid investment and save you a lot of money in the long run while alleviating the rise in global temperatures.
