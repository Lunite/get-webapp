Last month, we let you know about the exciting news of the government's [Green Home Grant](https://www.get-uk.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-for-you/), which would heavily subsidise measures to reduce wasted energy in your home.

We were hopeful this would include installing solar PV panels. After all, what better way to reduce energy wastage than to slash your reliance on grid energy? Unfortunately, the government doesn't see it the same way. Even so, going solar is still a no-brainer.

### How does it work?

In early July, the government announced a scheme called the Green Home Grant (also referred to as Green Energy Vouchers) to subsidise homeowners undertaking energy-saving measures such as home insulation. 

The advantages of this scheme are two-fold. First of all, it will help financially beleaguered households to reduce their energy bills, a saving that will be especially valuable as the post-COVID-19 recession begins to bite. Secondly, and just as importantly, it will help them reduce their carbon footprint and do their bit to fight climate change.

From September, anyone with a quote for measures such as home insulation can apply for two-thirds of the cost up to £5,000. Those on very low incomes, however, will be able to claim the full cost up to £10,000.

### Why No Solar?

On 4th August, the government announced which measures would be eligible for grants. As expected, these included a wide range of home insulation, as well as heat pumps. However, the only solar solution listed is the rather specialised solar water heating. There was no mention of generating solar power for general electricity needs.

This seems very short sighted. While all the measures included will help, they don't address perhaps the biggest issue of all. The National Grid is under immense pressure to produce enough electricity to meet the country's needs, much of it reliant on heavily polluting fossil fuels.

Expanding the number of homes generating their own solar electric energy would take some of that pressure off the National Grid, allowing it to put more emphasis on generating renewable energy. For whatever reason, though, the government doesn't seem to see it this way.

### Solar Is Still a No-brainer

Even without support from the Green Home Grants, however, converting your home to solar is still a no-brainer. Regardless of how deeply you care about cutting your carbon footprint, going solar can slash your energy bills.

This can amount to around £500 a year, and you may even be able to make extra by schemes to sell unused solar energy to the National Grid. At this rate, it won't take long to pay for the upfront costs and then start making pure profit.

It's even better at the moment. We currently have an [offer](https://www.get-uk.com/promo) of a 2.75kw system, with a battery, for £4,200 including VAT, with no deposit required. This is an all-in package that comes complete with install, warranties and aftercare package. [Get in touch with us](https://www.get-uk.com/promo) to find out more about how this can slash both your bills and your carbon footprint.
