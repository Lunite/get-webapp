**How we use the Information**

Green Energy Together will process – that means collect, store and use – the information you provide in a manner that is compatible with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We will endeavour to keep your information accurate and up to date and not keep it for longer than is necessary. In some instances, the law sets the length of time information has to be kept, but in most cases Green Energy Together will use its discretion to ensure that we do not keep records outside of our normal business requirements.

Our aim is not to be intrusive, and we undertake not to ask irrelevant or unnecessary questions. Moreover, the information you provide will be subject to rigorous measures and procedures to minimise the risk of unauthorised access or disclosure.

To administer your account, including informing you of any changes.

To carry out risk assessment, credit-referencing and fraud prevention.

To remind you about the quotations we’ve provided you with for a certain period after having visited our site.

To undertake market research with a view to better understanding the requirements of our customers.

Most importantly, to generally provide the best service to you that we can.

We may also contact credit reference agencies who will record the search. If we intend to use information for any other purposes, we’ll tell you when we collect it and you’ll have at least 28 days to object.

Why do we need to collect, process and store personal data?

For us to provide you with a product or service we need to collect personal data for correspondence purposes and/or detailed service provision. In any event, we are committed to ensuring that the information we collect, and use is appropriate for this purpose, and does not constitute an invasion of your privacy. We may pass your personal data on to our service providers who are contracted to Green Energy Together in the course of service provision. Our contractors are obliged to keep your details securely and use them only to fulfil the service they provide you on our behalf. Once your service need has been satisfied or the case has been closed, they will dispose of the details in line with Green Energy Together’s procedures. If we wish to pass your sensitive personal data onto a third party, we will only do so once we have obtained your consent unless we are legally required to do so.

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use personal data in the following circumstances:

to perform a contract, we are about to enter or have entered into with you

if it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and these are not overridden by your rights and interests where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

In order to process personal data, we must have a lawful reason. We always ensure that this is the case, and we set out our lawful bases below – note that more than one may apply: for example, if we inform you of changes to our privacynotice, we may process your personal data on the ground of complying with law and on the ground of legitimate interests.

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we fairly consider that we need it for another reason that is compatible with the original purpose.

What are the lawful bases for processing?

The lawful bases for processing are set out in Article 6 of the GDPR. At least one of these must apply whenever you process personal data:

Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.

Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.

Legal obligation: the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations).

Vital interests: the processing is necessary to protect someone’s life.

Public task: the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.

Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests. (This cannot apply if you are a public authority processing data to perform your official tasks.)

The primary reason for collecting and processing data will be contractual, however we may utilise a combination of the above, dependent upon the circumstances. We will be transparent in any interactions and ensure that the lawful basis of processing for each circumstance are documented and available.

**Contractual Necessity**

If you are our customer, we will process your personal data for the following purposes, on the legal basis that it is necessary for us to provide our products and services to you:

to identify you to respond to your inquiries to the extent necessary to provide pre-contractual information about our products and services to provide our products and services, including enabling them to be delivered to you to carry out billing and administration activities.

Accordingly, your failure to provide such personal data may hinder or prevent us from being able to perform a contract for you.

**Legitimate Interests**

We process your personal information for our legitimate business purposes, which include the following:

to conduct and manage our business

to enable us to carry out our services

to ensure our website and systems are secure

to improve and update our services for the benefit of our customers

to let you know about our products or services that we consider may be of interest to you: we carry out this processing on the legal basis that we have a legitimate interest in marketing our products and services, and only to the extent that we are permitted to do so by applicable direct marketing laws. Please see section below for further information about our marketing activities and regarding your right to opt out.

Whenever we process your personal data for these purposes, we ensure that your interests, rights and freedoms are carefully considered.

**Compliance with laws**

We may process your personal data in order to comply with applicable laws (for example, if we are required to co-operate with an investigation pursuant to a court order).

Consent

Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending marketing communications to you via e-mail \[or text message]. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.

We will always be clear whenever we intend to process on the basis of consent, and we will process lawfully and only for the purpose for which consent was given.

Do we share your personal data?

We are legally obliged to share data with Government agencies and regulatory bodies which may involve elements of personal data. We may also share your personal data with collection agencies.

Do you have to supply your personal data and if so WHY?

In short, the answer is no: however, it may affect your ability to receive our products and services if you do not do so. To form a contract with you, we will need some or all the personal data described above so that we can perform that contract or the steps that lead up to it: this is set out above in this notice. If we do not receive the data, the contract could not be performed.

If you sign up to our mailing list, you will have to provide certain personal data. Of course, you may decide to stop receiving our mailings at any time.

How long will your personal data be kept for?

We carefully consider the personal data that we store, and we will not keep your information in a form which identifies you for longer than is necessary for the purposes set out in this notice.

We use the following criteria to determine data retention periods for your personal data:

Retention in case of queries. We will retain your personal data as long as is necessary to deal with your queries. Retention for providing products or services. We will retain your personal data as long as is necessary for us to provide relevant products and services. Retention in case of claims. We will retain your personal data for as long as we may require it to defend claims that may be brought against us or our customers.

Retention in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. We will retain your personal data after we have provided products or services based on our legal and regulatory requirements: for example, UK tax law currently specifies a six-year period for retention of some of your personal data.
