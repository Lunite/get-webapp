Everyone's telling you to reduce your energy usage at home, but how do you do that, short of living in a cabin in the woods with no power connections? And, even if you knew how, could you afford to make the changes? In fact, there are several very simple steps you can take and far from being expensive, they'll actually save you money, as well as contributing to saving the planet. Here are some energy-saving tips, but remember, solar panels which harvest energy from the sun and turn it into electricity, will always be one of your best options.

1. ### Use a Smart Thermostat

Heating your home and the water you use can account for over half your energy bill, so saving here can have a big impact. You can set a smart thermostat to switch the heating off when you don't need it, or you can control it remotely from your phone.

This could save you around £75 a year and getting the setting right could do even more. Turning it down by just one degree could make a difference of around £80.

2. ### Turn Lights Off When You Don't Need Them

Leaving lights on when you're not using them could be costing you an extra £14 a year. There's a myth that switching lights off and on again uses more energy than leaving them on, but that's simply not true. While we're on the subject of lights, using low-energy lightbulbs can cut your consumption further. Switching to LED lights could mean a saving of £35 a year.

3. ### Make Standby Taboo

Do you leave your TV, computer, games console or kitchen appliances plugged in and on standby when you're not using them? This could be costing you up to £30 a year, as well as increasing your carbon footprint.

If you're leaving your tech on for convenience, you could have the best of both worlds by investing in smart plug socket controls that you can control from your phone.

4. ### Buy Energy Efficient Appliances

The energy efficiency of household appliances can vary enormously. For instance, the difference between the most and least efficient can amount to £41 a year for a washing machine or £139 for a fridge-freezer.

Of course, we're not suggesting you go out and buy new appliances. When you do have to replace one, though, make sure this is one the things you check. Which? tests appliances regularly and publishes the results on its website.

5. ### Make Your Home Smart

We've already mentioned smart controls, and it's worth extending these to as many systems and appliances as possible in your home. Besides the control they give you, they can also help you monitor your energy usage and identify where energy is being wasted.

Government figures suggest that this could save 2.8% on your electricity bills and 2% on gas bills.

6. ### Insulate Your Home

A thermal scan of an average house shows heat radiating out into the air — and that's heat you've paid for. Insulating your walls, roof, doors and windows will prevent a good deal of that loss while upgrading your doors and windows will add to that.

In all, the difference between a poorly insulated house and a well-insulated one can be as much as £280 a year.

7. ### Generate Your Own Renewable Energy

Most of us rely on energy from the National Grid. Not only is this expensive, but even now the majority is still generated from fossil fuel. Fitting your home with Solar panels and a battery-based storage solution can supply your own clean energy needs, and you can sell back any excess to the National Grid, slashing your bills by up to 70%.
