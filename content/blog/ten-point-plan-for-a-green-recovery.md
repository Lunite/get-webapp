  intro: Boris Johnsons "Green Industrial Revolution" announced on the 19th of
    November 2020 is welcome news for the economy and the environment, we guess
    in the fullness of time this government will elaborate on why small scale
    Solar & Storage is not included in any of future incentives. A 3KW solar
    system with 5KW of storage can take a 3 Bedroom home 60% of grid for as
    little as £4,500.00 a payback on the investment in less than 8 years. 70% of
    UK homes would be suitable for Solar, this would take pressure off the grid,
    we believe that we need a full mix of renewables, Solar, Wind and Nuclear
    alongside Storage, but Solar must be part of the game.

On November 19th UK prime minister Boris Johnson set out a 10-point plan for what he calls 'a green industrial revolution', an ambitious plan to deliver a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic effects on the economy and build towards the net-zero emissions target. The plan represents a fantastic new path for both the economy and the environment, we believe in the fullness of time this government will explain why small scale Solar & Storage is not included in any of future incentives.

A 3KW solar system with 5KW of storage can take a 3 Bedroom home 60% of grid for as little as £4,500.00 a payback on the investment in less than 8 years. 70% of UK homes would be suitable for Solar, this would take pressure off the grid, while cutting down energy bills and driving down emissions across the country.

According to the BBC, up to two-thirds of UK homes 'fail on energy efficiency targets'. Recent research indicates that 12 million homes fall below the C grade on Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), which grades properties from A-G. As a result, not only do residents pay larger energy bills, this also pumps tonnes more CO2 into the atmosphere than necessary.

We believe that we need a full mix of renewables, Solar, Wind and Nuclear alongside Storage, but Solar must be part of the game. Only this way it will be possible to address the gap between the British government current actions to tackle global warming and what is needed to meet its legally binding climate commitments.
