Green Energy Together are thrilled to announce a new opportunity for homeowners and business owners. Besides being your local solar and battery storage business based in Hertfordshire, we've now launched The Hertfordshire Solar Collective. This is a small group, comprising homeowners with the shared interest of leveraging their group buying power to obtain better prices for solar PV and battery storage systems. Members of the collective will enjoy discounts of up to 25%. 

We're excited to announce the launch of the programme's first round, which will run from September 2020 in Hertfordshire

## How does it work?

For every 50 sign ups we will begin a round of installations at 25% discount.

## Want to participate?

Any home or business owner can sign up individually to join the collective. Just fill in your details below. We'll then get in touch with you so that we can arrange to provide a no obligation desktop solar assessment and discounted solar quotation.  

So far 33 homeowners have signed up. Help us get to 50 so we can start the first round of installations.
